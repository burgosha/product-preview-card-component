## My process

As usual I first made a mockup of the html code structure and then proceeded with the stylesheet. This time I decided to use flexbox to organize the content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I put into practice my knowledge about flexbox.

I tested the use of media queries with changing background images depending on the screen size and learned new things about it.

I discovered a new method of centering elements on the browser screen.

The snippet for centering elements is shown below:

```body {
    ...
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    }
```

### Continued development

This experience has allowed me to realize that there is always something new to learn about HTML and CSS. Besides becoming necessary to use a more methodological order for problem solving.
In addition, the realized component is a good element that can be reused in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Normalize.css helped me to make browsers represent all elements more consistently.
- [Paul Irish Snippet](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) - This snippet helped me to give the box model I wanted. It applies to all elements.
